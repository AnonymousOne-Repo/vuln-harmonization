{{ known_info }}

Please summarize and extract the following fields. Only include information that is explicitly mentioned. Do not fabricate:

### Title
**Steps**:
1. If an explicit title exists, extract it as is.
2. If absent, generate a title using the format: <Product> + <Vulnerability Type> (e.g., 'Apache Struts RCE Vulnerability').
3. Limit the length to no more than 20 words.
**Example**:
```
Nginx HTTP/2 Module Buffer Overflow
```

### impact_info
**Steps**:
1. Extract the direct impact, such as data leakage, service disruption, or privilege escalation.
2. Include technical details such as attack vector (remote/local), trigger conditions.
3. Avoid speculative descriptions (e.g., 'may cause...').
**Example**:
```
Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code via crafted HTTP/2 requests.
```

### solution_info
**Steps**:
1. Prioritize official solutions (upgrade, patch, configuration changes).
2. If unavailable, extract mitigation strategies (e.g., WAF rules, access controls).
3. Mark temporary solutions explicitly as [Workaround].
**Example**:
```
Upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.7 or apply vendor patches. [Workaround] Disable TLSv1.3
```

### exploit_info
**Steps**:
1. Distinguish between Exploit (weaponized tool) and PoC (proof of concept).
2. Extract exploit complexity: Attack Complexity (Low/High).
3. Indicate exploit status: In the Wild / Theoretical.
**Example**:
```
{
  "exploits": "Public exploits available (Attack Complexity: Low)",
  "exploit_url": ["https://github.com/exploit-db/12345"]
}
```

### PoC_info
**Steps**:
1. Extract the PoC publishing platform (GitHub, ExploitDB).
2. Indicate the level of technical detail: Code Snippet / Full Demo.
**Example**:
```
{
  "PoC": "PoC published on GitHub (Full Demo)",
  "PoC_url": ["https://github.com/security/PoC"]
}
```

### patch_info
**Steps**:
1. Extract patch type: Official Patch / Vendor Advisory.
2. Indicate the source of the patch: GitHub Commit / Vendor Bulletin.
**Example**:
```
{
  "patch": "Fixed in GitHub commit a1b2c3d",
  "patch_url": ["https://github.com/project/commit/a1b2c3d"]
}
```

Leave any of these fields as null if no relevant info is available.
